# 1. Research and Comprehend
1.1 Introduction to AI
- What is AI? AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence. This involves reasoning, learning, perception, language understanding, and problem-solving.

- How AI Systems Work: AI systems rely on data, algorithms, and computational power. They use models (such as machine learning models) to process data, learn patterns, and make decisions or predictions.

- Role of Knowledge in AI: Knowledge is crucial for AI because it allows systems to "understand" the world. Without structured knowledge, AI would struggle to reason, make decisions, or learn from experience.

1.2 Overview of Knowledge Representation (KR)
- What is Knowledge Representation? In AI, knowledge representation refers to the methods and structures used to represent information about the world. The goal is to model knowledge in a way that an AI system can process and use to reason and make decisions.

# Forms of Knowledge Representation:

# - Semantic Networks:
  A semantic network represents knowledge as a graph of nodes (concepts) and edges (relationships).
  Example: In a medical diagnosis system, diseases and symptoms could be nodes, and the relationships between them (e.g., "causes," "is a symptom of") would be the edges.
- Frames:
  Frames are data structures representing stereotypical situations. Each frame contains slots (attributes) that describe the object or concept.
  Example: In an autonomous vehicle, a frame might represent "pedestrian," with slots for speed, direction, and proximity.
- Logic-Based Representations:
  Uses formal logic (e.g., propositional or first-order logic) to represent facts and rules.
  Example: A recommendation system may use logic to infer what products a user would like based on previous choices.
  How KR Enables AI: Knowledge representation allows AI systems to process complex information, reason about it, and make decisions based on the rules or structures encoded in the model.

 # 2. Hands-On Exploration
  2.1 Case Study Selection
- AI Application: Autonomous Vehicles
  Autonomous vehicles use knowledge representation to navigate, avoid obstacles, and interact with the environment.
- Knowledge Representation in Autonomous Vehicles:
  The system represents knowledge through a combination of frames (for objects like pedestrians or traffic signs), semantic networks (for road maps and traffic rules), and probabilistic models (to predict movements).
# 2.2 Representation Creation
- Problem: Obstacle Detection and Avoidance in Autonomous Vehicles
- Representation Model:
  A frame for representing different types of obstacles (e.g., cars, pedestrians, cyclists) with slots for size, speed, distance, and direction.
  A semantic network connecting roads, intersections, and traffic signals, showing how they relate to the vehicleâ€™s movement.
- Diagram:
  Create a visual showing how the vehicle identifies objects and determines how to respond (e.g., slow down for pedestrians, stop at red lights).
  Explanation:
  The AI system uses this representation to detect obstacles in real-time, assess the level of risk, and make a decision (e.g., slow down or change lanes).
